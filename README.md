<h1>Introduction</h1>
Currently, UNSW students have little to no available resources to manage their degree and university life. We have created a web application that allows UNSW students to effectively manage their degree through our interactive timetable which allows students to search up courses and drag and drop them onto the table. UNSWPlanner also allows students to read and create reviews for courses they have previously completed or are about to pick up. We have also created features which allow students to find other students to be 'study buddies' together as well as being able to find study spaces throughout the campus.
